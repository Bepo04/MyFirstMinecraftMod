My First Minecraft Mod

Introduction
============
Welcome to my first Minecraft mod repository!

As the name says, here I'll be working in a experimental and testing mod to practice and get started in 
Minecraft modding. Actually, I'm not getting started only in Minecraft modding, but I've started learning
programming and developing this year, so take care of me ;)

About the mod
=============
The mod is being developed in Minecraft java 1.20.4, and it will probably be very small. For now, the idea is
to create some simple items that brings some basic effects to the player. I'm not creating new effects, as this is
a test for me, I'll use the ones that already exist in-game.

The obtaining method is not decided yet, depending of the amount of time I spend making the basic items, I'll make
bigger or smaller afford on the other sections of the mod.

A list of a few ideas about possible items to develop:
· Pants with saturation effect: in order to use them in AFK farms where player has to kill enemies or mine blocks, so
you won't need a beacon to avoid dying of hunger.

Ideas that might never come, but that they seem interesting:
    · Creative inventory tab (For now, each item will be located in the tab that makes the most sense in each case).

    · Dropping from monsters: I've always loved the sensation of getting something with a very little drop rate in
    videogames, the minecraft trident is a very good example. If I've time I'd love to add this characteristic to some
    items.

    · Craftable items: as I've said, this is a project with the principal objective of improving my knowledge of developing,
    and getting a first contact of Minecraft modding, but as crafting is probably the principal mechanic in the game, that
    would be interesting to test it and create some new crafts.
        · Craftable End Portal?: this is a little improvement I've always wanted in Minecraft. Once you have arrived at the
        End and killed the Ender Dragon, I think that players could be able to build some end portals in the overworld (and
        why not in the nether?), although the price of crafting a End Portal block should be very expensive, I think it would
        be beautiful. As end portals works anywhere in the overworld if you put them correctly, I think the best way to
        develop this idea should be making the End Portal block craftable.
